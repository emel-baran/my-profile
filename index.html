      <h2> What do I listen to during my 1 hour journey to go to my school ?  </h2>
      <p2> In three words : Lana Del Rey. She's a genius and the queen of alternative music. My favorite song of her is "Radio". Don't hesistate to stream her new album "Did you know that there's a tunnel under ocean blvd", it's insanely good.</p2>

     <h2> The "bon appétit" topic </h2>
     <p2> As a half Turkish and French human being, I am blessed with really good food. My favorite meals are Kebab, Iskender and Bibimbap. When it comes to desserts, I always love me a piece of Cheesecake or a Paris-Brest.  </p2>

    <h2> Let's make books trendy again... </h2>
    <p2> To achieve a perfect coquette girl aesthetic for summer (which is coming soon), it is essential to have a book everywhere we go. I love books, specifically volume of poetry. I love Ocean Vuong and Mary Oliver when it comes to poetry. You will find me at Fnac La Défense this summer in the book section where I will be doing my internship :) Don't hesitate to come see me ! </p2>
